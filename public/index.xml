      <description>The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical hypothesis that has puzzled mathematicians for decades. Also known as the &amp;ldquo;3x + 1 problem&amp;rdquo;, it involves taking any positive integer and applying a simple process: if the number is even, divide it by two; if it&amp;rsquo;s odd, triple it and add one. The conjecture states that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.&#xA;In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore this conjecture using Python, specifically visualizing the journey of a number as it goes through this process.</description>
