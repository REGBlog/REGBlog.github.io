This past summer, I embarked on an incredible journey with Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Seattle, which led me to discover some of Washington State's most beautiful places. From serene trails and bustling urban squares to breathtaking mountain views, I've compiled a list of my top 10 favorite spots that capture the essence of the Pacific Northwest. Join me as I recount the adventures and scenery that made my summer in Seattle an unforgettable experience.

### 10\. Coal Creek Natural Area

The Coal Creek Natural Area, tucked away near the Red Town Trailhead, was my first incursion into the lush Washington landscape. With trails that wander gently through lush woods, this area is a sanctuary for those looking to escape the city's bustle without venturing too far. As you walk along the paths, you're walking through history; the area's coal mining past is still evident in the ruins and informational plaques that dot the landscape. The forest's peace, the soft rustle of leaves, and the occasional historic relic make for an educational and serene outing. It's an accessible adventure for all ages and abilities, providing a window into the state's dynamic past enveloped in natural beauty. Don't forget to arm yourself with bug spray -- the forest is alive in more ways than one!

### 9\. Occidental Square

Nestled in the heart of Seattle, Occidental Square is a testament to the city's ability to blend the historical with the contemporary. This charming cobblestone square is a nucleus of urban activity, surrounded by a canopy of maple trees and the sleek lines of a modern pergola. The square pulses with the city's energy yet maintain an air of tranquility, making it the perfect place to unwind. On any given day, you might stumble upon live music filling the air, art installations capturing the imagination, or community events that bring together locals and visitors alike. It's a slice of Seattle life that exemplifies the city's cultural heartbeat, offering a peaceful break amidst the downtown skyscrapers.

### 8\. The Spheres

Amid Seattle's urban jungle, The Spheres emerge as a striking symbol of Amazon's commitment to innovative workspaces and the importance of nature within them. These glass domes house a richly diverse botanical garden, creating an environment where employees and visitors can connect with nature. The Spheres are not just an office space but a horticultural haven inviting contemplation and creativity. And yes, the famed banana stand outside offers a sweet treat to anyone passing by -- a quirky and generous Amazon tradition that captures the company's spirit. As an AWS intern, the ability to wander through this green oasis was a highlight of my time in Seattle, though the public can also savor this verdant retreat with prior registration. The Spheres are a futuristic merge of nature and architecture, where the rainforest meets the corporate world.

### 7\. Leavenworth, WA

Leavenworth is a slice of Bavaria right in the heart of Washington State, with timber-framed buildings and alpine scenery. As you approach this charming village, the transformation is startling: the architecture, the murals, and even the lederhosen-clad figures make you feel like you've stepped into a different continent. With an abundance of German beer, traditional music, and restaurants serving hearty sausages and schnitzels, Leavenworth is a feast for the senses. The Tumwater Penstock Trail, easily accessible and offering gentle terrain, is a favorite for families and casual hikers. As you traverse the trail, the rushing waters of the Wenatchee River and the towering mountains create a symphony of natural beauty. It's a place that blends outdoor adventure with cultural richness, a must-visit for anyone craving a unique adventure.

### 6\. North Bend, WA & Snoqualmie, WA

The appeal of North Bend is captured in the imposing presence of Mount Si, a monolith that dominates the landscape and calls to adventurers and photographers alike. My experience in North Bend was amplified by the moments I shared with my mother as we enjoyed the comforts of a cozy Airbnb, with the mountain's silhouette framing our view. We also got the chance to visit Snoqualmie Falls which was a beautiful sight to see! Driving along Highway 90, the road unwinds like a ribbon amidst the wilderness, offering a journey as picturesque as the destination. The area boasts a variety of trails ranging from the leisurely to the strenuous, all promising rewarding views and the serenity of the great outdoors. Whether you're there for the hiking, the views, or to enjoy a peaceful moment in nature's embrace, North Bend and Snoqualmie is where Washington's natural brilliance is on full display.

### 5\. Peshastin Pinnacles Loop

The Peshastin Pinnacles are Cashmere's natural skyscrapers, extending out of the earth like the spires of a sandstone cathedral. The loop trail that winds around these formations is only a mile long but packs a punch with its elevation gain and sandy terrain, making it a mini-adventure perfect for those looking for a quick but satisfying hike. The effort to reach the summit is immediately rewarded with a panorama that stretches across the valley, framing orchards and the winding river with a backdrop of the Cascades' rugged peaks. It's a sight that encapsulates the raw beauty of Central Washington and leaves hikers with a sense of accomplishment and awe. For those who reach the top, it's not just a hike; it's a moment of connection with the vastness of nature and the incredible landscapes that define the Pacific Northwest.

### 4\. Wallace Falls State Park

Wallace Falls State Park is a sanctuary for hikers and nature lovers in the heart of the green Snohomish County. The park's centerpiece, a 5-mile hike through evergreen forests, leads adventurers past a triumvirate of cascading waterfalls, each more impressive as you ascend. Rushing water is your constant companion as you navigate the trail's switchbacks and elevation changes. The main attraction, the Middle Falls, provides a viewpoint that offers a mesmerizing sight of water and mist mingling in a perpetual dance. This hike isn't just a physical journey; it's a chance to witness the power and grace of nature's architecture carved out over eons, providing an energizing and meditative peace.

### 3\. Poulsbo, WA

Poulsbo's nickname, 'Little Norway', nods to its deeply rooted Scandinavian heritage. With its scenic marina and Liberty Bay views, this waterfront town is a cultural gem where the Nordic legacy lives on through architecture, cuisine, and local traditions. Kayaking through the bay's calm waters offers a serene perspective of the landscape, while the bustling downtown area, with its artisan shops and museums, invites exploration. Evenings in Poulsbo are best spent at the bay-side bar, where the setting sun casts a golden glow over the water, and the town's lights begin to gleam, reflecting the quiet spirit of Nordic evenings.

### 2\. Kendall Katwalk

The Kendall Katwalk trail is a rite of passage for those with a penchant for high-altitude thrills. This demanding 14-mile trek through the Alpine Lakes Wilderness challenges even seasoned hikers with its elevation gain and rugged terrain. However, the trail rewards perseverance with sublime alpine scenery and the eponymous Katwalk---a narrow path cut into a sheer granite cliff. Reaching the Katwalk's highest point, hikers are greeted with expansive views of the surrounding peaks, valleys, and the distant horizon. It's a moment of unparalleled tranquility and grandeur, where the vastness of nature is both humbling and uplifting. The Kendall Katwalk is more than a hike; it's a pilgrimage for the soul, offering a glimpse of Washington's wild heart.

### 1\. Olympic National Park

Olympic National Park is a microcosm of Pacific Northwest wilderness, offering an unrivaled diversity of ecosystems, from rainforests to rugged coastlines to mountain vistas. The iconic Highway 101 loop around the park is a journey through these varied landscapes, with each turn revealing another natural marvel. Lake Crescent is one such treasure, a deep, glacially-carved lake where the still waters mirror the surrounding peaks. Here, time seems to stand still as you sit by the lake's edge, the silence only broken by the gentle lapping of water. Another unforgettable stop is Rialto Beach, where the Pacific Ocean greets you with its mighty waves and driftwood-strewn shores. The experience of watching the sun dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, is a poignant reminder of nature's majesty.
