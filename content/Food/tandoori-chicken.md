### Ingredients:

**For Chicken & Marinade:**

-   1/2 cup (5 ounces) Greek yogurt (0% fat used here)
-   2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil
-   4 to 5 cloves garlic, finely minced or pressed
-   2 tablespoons lemon juice
-   1 tablespoon garam masala
-   1 tablespoon paprika (smoked variety preferred)
-   1 teaspoon each of turmeric, cumin, coriander, ground ginger
-   1 teaspoon kosher salt
-   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
-   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, to taste)
-   1 to 1.25 pounds of boneless skinless chicken breasts (breast tenders for quicker cooking)

**For Dipping Sauce (Optional):**

-   About 2/3 cup (6 ounces) of Greek yogurt
-   2 tablespoons olive oil
-   2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
-   2 tablespoons honey
-   1 teaspoon kosher salt
-   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
-   1/4 cup fresh cilantro, finely minced (for garnishing, optional)

### Instructions for the Grilled Tandoori Chicken

**Marinating the Chicken:**

1.  **Preparation of Marinade**: In a gallon-sized zip-top bag, pour in the Greek yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, and all the spices - garam masala, paprika, turmeric, cumin, coriander, ground ginger, kosher salt, black pepper, and optional cayenne pepper.
2.  **Adding the Chicken**: Place your boneless skinless chicken breasts or breast tenders into the bag.
3.  **Coating the Chicken**: Seal the bag and gently squish it to ensure it is thoroughly coated with the marinade. This step is crucial for infusing the chicken with all the aromatic flavors.
4.  **Marinating Time**: Place the bag in the refrigerator. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. For an even more robust flavor, you can marinate the chicken overnight.

**Grilling the Chicken:**

1.  **Preheat the Grill**: Set your grill to medium-high heat. Preheating and cooking the chicken are essential for achieving the perfect char. Though this recipe states grilled tandoori chicken, using a pan on the stovetop also works wonders!
2.  **Grilling the Chicken**: Using tongs, remove the chicken from the marinade and place it onto the grill. Discard the leftover marinade and bag. Grill each side of the chicken for about 4 to 5 minutes. If you're using breast tenders, they will cook more quickly, approximately in 8 minutes. Larger chicken breasts may require additional grilling time. The goal is to achieve a nice char on the outside while ensuring the chicken is fully cooked and juicy.
3.  **Resting the Chicken**: After grilling, set the chicken aside to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Resting the chicken allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring each bite is moist and flavorful.

**Making the Dipping Sauce:**

1.  **Combining Sauce Ingredients**: In a small bowl, combine Greek yogurt, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, honey, kosher salt, and black pepper. Whisk these together until you achieve a smooth and well-combined sauce.
2.  **Adjusting the Flavor**: Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning and consistency according to your preference. Add more salt, pepper, honey, or olive oil to suit your taste.
3.  **Serving**: When ready to serve, you can optionally garnish the grilled chicken with finely minced fresh cilantro. Serve the chicken with the prepared dipping sauce on the side for an added layer of flavor.

### Notes

**Storage Tips:**

-   **Storing the Chicken**: While this Grilled Tandoori Chicken is best enjoyed fresh, it can be conveniently stored in the refrigerator. Place any leftovers in an airtight container; they will remain delicious for up to 5 days. This makes it an excellent option for meal prepping or enjoying leftovers for quick and tasty lunches or dinners.
-   **Dipping Sauce Storage**: The homemade dipping sauce can be kept for up to 1 week when refrigerated. Store it in a sealed container or jar. The flavors may even intensify over time, enhancing your subsequent culinary experiences.
