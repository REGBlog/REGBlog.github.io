## Ingredients

Here’s what you’ll need to bring this Italian Bean Soup to life:

- ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, mashed
- 2 carrots, chopped into coins
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 3 cans (15 ounces each) of beans, drained and rinsed (mix it up—cannellini, kidney, and chickpeas work great!)
- 1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes, with juices
- 2-3 cups vegetable broth
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- (Optional) ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- (Optional) ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- 3 cups fresh spinach

## Step-by-Step Instructions

**1. Sauté the Aromatics**

Start by heating the olive oil over medium-low heat in your soup pot or Dutch oven. Add the diced onion, garlic, red bell pepper, carrots, and celery. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and sauté for 7-10 minutes, until the onion is soft and translucent.

**2. Add the Seasonings**

Stir in the Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, ground black pepper, and any optional seasonings (garlic or onion powder). Cook for another minute to release the fragrant aromas.

**3. Add Beans, Tomatoes, and Broth**

Prepare the beans by rinsing and draining them. Add them to the pot along with the diced tomatoes (including their juices) and vegetable broth.

**4. Simmer to Perfection**

Toss in a bay leaf, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the soup simmer gently for about 30 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld beautifully.

**5. (Optional) Blend for Creaminess**

If you prefer a thicker, creamier soup, transfer about two cups of the soup to a blender and blend until smooth. Return the blended mixture to the pot and stir.

**6. Add Fresh Spinach**

Remove and discard the bay leaf. Add the spinach to the pot, stirring until it wilts. For a burst of brightness, consider adding a splash of red wine vinegar or a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

**7. Serve & Enjoy**

Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with freshly chopped parsley if desired. Serve with warm, crusty bread for dipping and enjoy every comforting bite!

## Tips & Variations

- Make it heartier: Add cooked pasta, such as small shells or ditalini, for a more filling meal.
- Boost the flavor: Try adding a parmesan rind during the simmering process for extra richness.
- Spice it up: Add more red pepper flakes or a pinch of cayenne for a kick of heat.
- Use different greens: Swap out spinach for kale or Swiss chard for a slightly different texture and taste.

## Serving Suggestions

This Italian Bean Soup is a complete meal on its own, but here are a few ways to elevate your dining experience:

- Crusty Bread: Perfect for soaking up that flavorful broth.
- Side Salad: A simple arugula or mixed greens salad adds a fresh, crunchy contrast.
- Wine Pairing: A glass of Chianti or another medium-bodied red wine pairs beautifully with this dish.
